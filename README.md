Indy Civic Hackathon Idea


General Idea
============

Creating a way for a user to easily submit a location (using HTML5 geo location) that has a pothole that needs repair.  There will be a rating system for how severe the pothole is.  There will also be a way to view on a map areas that have potholes already reported.



Public Data
============

We will integrate public data already collected and provided by Socrata into our web/mobile app.


MOLE POINTS!
============

Create a fun point system that will affect users rank and earn badges, making them want to continue to submit pothole locations
